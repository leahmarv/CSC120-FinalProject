# CSC120-FinalProject
To approach this project, first I created a map of the forest where the game takes place. Next, I decided the different game elements that I would include: the player, a bear, a compass, and signs. Then I drafted the commands and created an initial architecture diagram. Next I programmed the functionality of the different classes.

I learned that it is easy to get stuck on the functionality of classes while not having a working game. The text entry system in my game doesn't work, although I do have a map and all the other game elements coded.

I wish that I had implemented the map more efficiently by creating some sort of Hash Table or other array with the x and y coordinates separately references, rather than having to combine the x and y coordinates for the player and cast them to a string to move.

If I had unlimited time I would like to make the text entry functionality work and additionally add more animals and random encounters with natural hazards.

I would give my past self the advice to not be afraid to ask for help when I need it. I have been really struggling on this project and it reached a point where it felt much too late to reach out.
