This file will contain documentation for all commands available in your game.

Note:  It's a good idea to also make this list available inside the game, in response to a `HELP` command.


# SPOILER ALERT

If your game includes challenges that must be overcome to win, also list them below.

The bear must be scared away by singing if it is a black bear, or by freezing in place if it is a brown bear. The bear can also be distracted with an apple picked from a tree.
